Description: Created an anachronistic representation of the library of Alexandria. It only includes 2 shelves and 6 books. As the sands of time continue to fall, more books will undoubtedly be discovered from this legendary library. The library understands that it has shelves, and all books. Books are ordered by author, title, year published, and shelves. The books, as in a real library, can be shelved, or unshelved (what happens when they are unshelved remains a mystery)!

** Add your own books, and shelve them, for future generations to enjoy **
